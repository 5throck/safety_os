# Benefit-Risk Assessor Skill

## Overview
Conducts structured benefit-risk assessment for marketed pharmaceuticals per EU GVP Module 12. Supports multiple frameworks to accommodate different decision contexts.

## Frameworks

### PrOACT-URL (FDA)
- **Pr**oblem: Define decision context
- **O**bjectives: Establish endpoints
- **A**lternatives: Compare options (maintain / restrict / withdraw)
- **C**onsequences: Effects of each alternative
- **T**rade-offs: B vs R balance
- **U**ncertainty: Confidence intervals
- **R**isk tolerance: Acceptable threshold
- **L**inks: Chain of reasoning

### BRAT (PhRMA)
Benefit-Risk Action Team framework:
- Decision context
- Outcome identification
- Value tree construction
- Effects table
- Uncertainty evaluation
- Visualization

### MCDA (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis)
Quantitative scoring:
- Define criteria (benefits and risks)
- Assign weights (stakeholder input)
- Score each criterion (0-1)
- Calculate weighted sum
- Sensitivity analysis

### Qualitative Narrative
For complex cases where quantification is impractical:
- Structured narrative
- Expert judgment
- Consensus building

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Define Decision Context
- Initial evaluation / routine PBRER / signal-triggered / re-evaluation
- Affected population (indication, demographics)
- Time horizon

### Step 2: Benefit Identification
- Primary efficacy endpoints (pivotal trials)
- Real-world effectiveness (post-market)
- Patient-reported outcomes
- Unmet medical need (comparator landscape)

### Step 3: Risk Identification
- Important identified risks (RMP)
- Important potential risks
- New signals in reporting period
- Cumulative ADR profile
- Quality issues affecting safety

### Step 4: Value Tree Construction
- Hierarchical model of benefits and risks
- Effects table: drug vs comparator vs no treatment

### Step 5: Stakeholder Weighting
- Patient perspective (what matters most)
- Clinician perspective (efficacy/safety priorities)
- Regulatory perspective (acceptable thresholds)

### Step 6: Score Integration
- MCDA: weighted sum of scores
- PrOACT: trade-off analysis
- Qualitative: structured narrative

### Step 7: Uncertainty Analysis
- Statistical confidence in evidence
- Missing data impact
- Sensitivity analysis (vary weights, scores)

### Step 8: Decision
- Favorable: maintain marketing authorization
- Favorable with monitoring: additional PV activities
- Uncertain: more data needed
- Unfavorable: restrict or withdraw

### Step 9: Documentation
- Benefit-Risk report per framework
- Submission for regulatory review

}
```

## Korean-Specific Considerations

### Re-evaluation Triggers
- 5-7 year cycle post-approval
- New safety signals (priority review)
- Foreign authority action
- Pediatric use expansion

### MFDS Communication
- Pre-submission meeting recommended
- Korean labeling implications
- Population-specific considerations (Korean ethnic pharmacokinetics)

## Integration

- **Input from**: `gvp-pbrer-record.json`, `gvp-signal-record.json`, `gvp-rmp-record.json`
- **Output to**: `gvp-br-record.json`
- **Triggers**: PBRER cycle, signal events, re-evaluation requests

## v2 Roadmap
- AI-assisted value tree generation
- Real-time stakeholder weight collection
- Probabilistic MCDA with Bayesian updates

## Legal Disclaimer
> Skill automation only. Final benefit-risk decisions require qualified Drug Safety Officer, Medical Director, and MFDS coordination per EU GVP Module 12.
