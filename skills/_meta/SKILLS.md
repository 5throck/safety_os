# SKILLS.md — Skill Lifecycle Registry

> Single Source of Truth for all project skills in `skills/`.  
> The `layer` column drives `publish-to-template.ts` (L1 sync) and `create-l2-scaffold.ts` (L2 scaffold).  
> Platform skills (`.claude/skills/`, `.gemini/skills/`) are tracked by `verify-platform-lifecycle.ts` — not here.  
> Machine parsing: `layer-filter.ts` reads the `## Registry` section only.
