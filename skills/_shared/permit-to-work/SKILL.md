# Permit to Work

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when a worker or supervisor requests authorization for non-routine, high-risk, or regulated work activities including but not limited to: hot work (welding, cutting, grinding), confined space entry, work at height, electrical isolation, and chemical handling. PTW is required before work commences.

## Steps

1. **Work Type Identification** — Classify the work type (hot work, confined space, electrical, height, chemical, general high-risk). Select the applicable PTW form template.
2. **Risk Assessment** — Invoke the `risk-assessment` skill. The completed risk assessment must be attached to the PTW before issuance. Risk level must be acceptable (below site threshold) or controls must reduce residual risk to acceptable.
3. **Control Measure Verification** — Confirm all required control measures are in place prior to issuance: isolation verified, PPE available, emergency equipment present, communication established.
4. **Permit Issuance** — Issue the permit with: permit number, work description, work area, permitted personnel, valid time window (start/expiry), required controls, issuing authority signature.
5. **Post-Work Sign-Off** — Upon completion, the performing authority signs off confirming work area is safe and restored. Permit is formally closed. Document any deviations or incidents.

## Output Format

Save permit record to `memory/findings/ptw-YYYY-MM-DD-<permit-number>.md`:

## Legal Notes

- 산업안전보건법 제38조 mandates that employers implement safety measures for work with risk of falls, collapse, fire, or explosion.
- 산업안전보건법 제39조 mandates health protection measures for work involving hazardous substances or conditions.
- PTW systems are considered a best-practice administrative control under these articles. Permits must not be back-dated or issued after work commences.
- This skill provides workflow assistance only and does not constitute legal advice.
