## [Unreleased]

### Changed (2026-06-25 — Execution Plan Boilerplate Unification to `/sync` Single Row)

The variant execution plan boilerplate required two separate terminating rows — **N-1 (Lifecycle Update)** dispatched to `lifecycle-manager (workspace) / pm (variant)` and **N (Final QA Audit)** to `auditor (workspace) / pm (variant)` — which conflicted with the workspace root policy (workspace `AGENTS.md §5.1`) where `/sync` handles lifecycle update + full audit + commit + push + PR in a single pipeline. The variant boilerplate also omitted the `/sync` row entirely, leaving the lifecycle/audit steps it mandated with no pipeline to execute them. Unified all three variant governance files to the workspace single-`/sync`-row policy. Same "Truth-in-Documentation" principle as prior cleanups: the documented boilerplate must match the implemented `/sync` pipeline.

- **CLAUDE.md §5** ("Mandatory Execution Plan Display"): replaced the 3-row table (`1` + `N-1` + `N`) with a 2-row table (`1` + `N` `/sync`); removed the Context rule (workspace-root vs variant lifecycle/auditor dispatch) since `/sync` handles both; added a rule stating `/sync` is the mandatory final step covering lifecycle + audit + commit + push + PR.
- **GEMINI.md §2** (`implementation_plan.md` artifact template): replaced the `N-1`/`N` Step rows with a single `/sync` `N` row + rule (inside the code-fence).
- **GEMINI.md §5** ("Mandatory Execution Plan Display"): added the `/sync` `N` row + rule to the existing 1-row table.
- **AGENTS.md**: added a new "Execution Plan Boilerplate" subsection under PM Gateway Policy (single `/sync` row table + cross-reference to workspace `AGENTS.md §5`); the variant AGENTS.md previously had no execution plan policy at all.
- **Scope note**: workspace root `templates/common/AGENTS.md` carries the same legacy N-1/N boilerplate but was left untouched per CLAUDE.md §9 boundary isolation (workspace-root template vs variant cannot be modified in the same session); deferred to a follow-up task.
- **Verification**: `git stash` baseline confirmed the 6 `audit.ts` failures are pre-existing structural drift (unrelated to this change); `bun scripts/safety-audit.ts` → 582 files, 0 errors; platform parity — CLAUDE.md and GEMINI.md carry an identical `/sync` policy (model differs per platform: `claude-sonnet-4-6` vs `gemini-3.5-flash`).

### Added (2026-06-21 — meeting-facilitation Skill Registration Parity)

`meeting-facilitation` was a skill in name only: it existed as the `/meeting` slash command (parity-paired on both platforms) and as a stub in the project-root `skills/` registry, but was ABSENT from `.claude/skills/` and `.gemini/skills/` — the only paths the native Skill tool scans. So `Skill(skill="meeting-facilitation")` returned "Unknown skill", directly contradicting the documented "used on both platforms" claim. Final item of the Truth-in-Documentation cleanup.

- **Registered** `.claude/skills/meeting-facilitation/SKILL.md` + `.gemini/skills/meeting-facilitation/SKILL.md` (byte-identical parity). The canonical `/meeting` command already carried valid SKILL.md frontmatter (`metadata.triggers` etc.), so the skill body is the proven process verbatim, with one platform-neutral note to keep the skill and the command in sync.
- **Confirmed resolvable**: `meeting-facilitation` now appears in the platform available-skills list; `Skill(skill="meeting-facilitation")` resolves on both Claude and Antigravity.
- **Scope correction (PM verification)**: an earlier plan proposed backfilling 3 "missing" Gemini skills (`api-documentation`, `research-analysis`, `documentation-writing`). All three carry `gemini-parity: skip` — they are intentionally Claude-only per the §10 lifecycle rule. **No backfill performed**; the count mismatch was a false gap, not a parity violation.
- **Verification**: `diff` of the two SKILL.md → IDENTICAL; `bun scripts/skill-lifecycle-audit.ts` → 41 skills, 0 errors; `bun scripts/safety-audit.ts` → 582 files, 0 errors.

### Changed (2026-06-21 — Superpowers Plugin Policy Cleanup; Native Platform Parity)

Both Claude Code and Antigravity now ship native subagent dispatch and plan mode, so external "superpowers plugin" install/leverage instructions are obsolete. Removed every instruct-the-PM-to-install/leverage-an-external-plugin reference; the valuable 3-tier Model Selection Override guidance is preserved (it is platform-native, not plugin-dependent). Same "Truth-in-Documentation" principle as the code-graph cleanup: documented capability must match implemented capability.

- **CLAUDE.md + GEMINI.md**: renamed `#### Superpowers Plugin & Cost Optimization (3-Tier Strategy)` → `#### Cost Optimization (3-Tier Strategy)`; reframed the lead from "PM MUST leverage the superpowers plugin" to "uses the platform's native subagent dispatch and plan mode"; dropped the dangling `AGENTS.md#superpowers-plugin--...` link (AGENTS.md never had that section). The 3-tier `Model Selection Overrides` bullets kept verbatim per platform (Claude: opus/sonnet/haiku; Gemini: 3.1-pro/3.5-flash).
- **Skill Resolution Priority table (both files)**: Priority-3 row `superpowers/brainstorming, superpowers/writing-plans` → "Platform-native skills (built-in plan mode and subagent capabilities, no external plugin)"; the canonical "brainstorm" conflict row likewise points to platform-native skills.
- **`docs/_meta/superpowers/plans/*.md`** (2 MCP-server implementation plans): "REQUIRED: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development / executing-plans" header → "Use native subagent dispatch (if available) or native plan mode". Directory name retained (historical; it documents the 3 active MCP servers).
- **Validators**: `scripts/validate-md-language.ts` exclusion path corrected `docs/superpowers/` → `docs/_meta/superpowers/` (the real nested path — the old exclusion never matched, so plan docs were not actually excluded); `scripts/validate-doc-folder.ts` removed the dead `'superpowers'` entry from `OPTIONAL_FOLDERS` (validator checks top-level `docs/`, but the folder is nested under `_meta/`, so the entry could never match). Both bumped (`1.4.1`, `1.0.1`).
- **Verification**: `grep superpowers` in CLAUDE/GEMINI/AGENTS → 0 refs; both validators exit 0; `bun scripts/safety-audit.ts` → 582 files, 0 errors.

### Removed (2026-06-21 — Code-Graph Remnant Cleanup; Truth-in-Documentation)

Completed the code-graph removal begun 2026-06-16. The codegraph MCP and the Neo4j "Knowledge Graph Traceability Model" were never wired into `.mcp.json`; their design docs and dead runtime artifacts persisted as false capability claims, which is unsafe in a GxP/audit context. Enforces a new **"Truth-in-Documentation"** principle: documented capability = implemented capability; unimplemented items are archived and annotated.

- **Deleted dead remnants**: `evidence-models/graph-schema.json` (0 references), `scripts/generate-playbook.ts` (stale generator reading nonexistent `docs/blueprint/`), and the CodeGraph MCP init block from `scripts/setup.sh` + `scripts/setup.ps1` (was still running `npx @colbymchenry/codegraph`).
- **Corrected** `_ORIGIN.md` false claim ".mcp.json (codegraph only)" → accurate active servers (`k_skill`, `legalize_kr`, `mcp_kr_legislation`).
- **Archived** unimplemented design docs to `docs/_meta/archive/code-graph/` (with a NOT-IMPLEMENTED README): blueprint `18-knowledge-graph.md`, `19-graph-schema.md`, `appendix/H-knowledge-graph-examples.md`, `architecture/knowledge-graph-ingestion.md`, and the `v4.0-playbook-2026-06-06.md` snapshot.
- **Re-specified agents** off the non-existent graph: `training-agent.md` and `audit-agent.md` now describe compliance/audit traceability via the LIVE mechanism — `evidence-models/*.json` + workflow `schema.yaml` `legal_basis` fields + `regulations/KR/legal-glossary.yaml` SSOT. `AGENTS.md` Training roster line updated to match. Zero residual Neo4j/graph capability claims across `agents/`.
- **Annotated** the 4 remaining blueprint docs with embedded graph refs (`02-architecture.md` diagram node fixed + banner; `04-agent-catalog.md`, `05-implementation-roadmap.md`, `appendix/A-agent-definitions.md` bannered) as NOT-IMPLEMENTED historical design, rather than gutting the broader docs.
- **Verification**: `bun scripts/safety-audit.ts` → 582 files, 0 errors; active-area `codegraph|neo4j|knowledge graph` grep → 0 unannotated hits.

### Changed (2026-06-21 — Korean-Regulation Domain READMEs → Layer C Korean-Canonical)

Applied the Layer C (Korean-canonical) policy to the **4 Korean-regulation industry domains**, converting their workflow READMEs from English-first to fully Korean-canonical for the Korean EHS/GxP practitioners who use them. This operationalizes the documentation language pivot for the human-operational layer (Layer C) — international-regulation domains (gcp/gvp/glp/meddevice) correctly remain Layer B (English-preferred) and were not touched.

- **ehsconst** (Construction Safety, 9), **ehschem** (Chemical Plant, 8), **gasterm** (Gas Terminal, 8), **powergen** (Power Generation, 8) — **33 READMEs total** rewritten to Korean body + canonical H1 `# <Korean> (<Title Case English>) Workflow` matching the established `gmp` pattern.
- **Content fidelity preserved** (verified): all evidence-record JSON filenames, technical identifiers/ref codes (`msds_record_ref`, `psm_psi_ref`, `legal_basis`, `permit_id`, etc.), cross-domain reference paths, and workflow step structure/numbering are byte-identical to the originals. Language conversion only — no logic, scope, or structural changes.
- **Korean statute citations standardized** from `regulations/KR/legal-glossary.yaml` SSOT as `한글명 (English gloss) 제N조` (e.g. `중대재해처벌법 (SAPA) 제12조`, `고압가스안전관리법 (High-Pressure Gas Safety Control Act) 제17조`, `전기사업법 (Electric Utility Act) 제47조`). International standard names (GHS, OSHA PSM) retained in English.
- **Verification**: `bun scripts/safety-audit.ts` → 583 files, 0 errors; canonical-pattern grep → 0 non-canonical titles.

### Changed (2026-06-21 — Documentation Language Policy Pivot: Korean-Default)

Pivoted the documentation language policy from English-default to **Korean-default**, reflecting that Safety OS is a Korea-only EHS/GxP platform serving Korean practitioners exclusively. Forcing English on human operational documentation was counterproductive (usability loss, double maintenance, no international audience). English is now retained ONLY where a justification applies: **Layer A** (system/agent layer — governance files, agent definitions, code, schemas) for cross-platform AI-agent instruction clarity and L1–L2 fork parity, and **Layer B** (international-regulation content — ICH/OECD/GHS/PIC-S/ISO).

- **§4 Language Policy rewritten** in `CLAUDE.md` + `GEMINI.md` (byte-identical body, platform parity held) as a 3-layer classification: Layer A (English required — internationalization), Layer B (English-preferred — international regulation), Layer C (Korean canonical — human operational docs: workflow READMEs, scope docs, user guides). Korean statute proper nouns always preserved as `Korean (English gloss)` per audit-trail integrity.
- **Legal/regulatory glossary SSOT** added at `regulations/KR/legal-glossary.yaml` — 19 Korean statutes (80 codebase-grounded article citations) + 20 international standards. Serves as the canonical statute→English-gloss reference and the validator's Korean allowlist input.
- **`validate-md-language.ts` reoriented** (v1.3.0 → v1.4.0): loads the glossary statute keys as an allowlist so statute citations pass in Layer A files; Layer C operational docs remain Korean-allowed by default. Glossary load failure fails loudly (never silently allows all Korean).

### Changed (2026-06-21 — CONSTITUTION.md Reroute + Repo Cleanup)

- **P0 — `CONSTITUTION.md` reference reroute**: Rewrote the 3-line `CONSTITUTION.md` stub into a concise governance index (Required Reading + Governance Sections tables). Rerouted **12 broken links** across `CLAUDE.md` (6), `GEMINI.md` (5), and `AGENTS.md` (1) to valid in-file anchors. Half the links pointed to nonexistent stub anchors (`CONSTITUTION.md#3`/`#5`) and half to a nonexistent `docs/constitution/` directory; the actual governance content already lived inline in `CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md`, so links were redirected there rather than duplicating content. CLAUDE.md ↔ GEMINI.md platform parity maintained.
- **P1 — Repo cleanup**: Added `templates/common/scripts/` to `.gitignore` (L0/L1 workspace template infrastructure not needed in this L2 variant) and removed its stale auto-generated `README.md` (which referenced a nonexistent `SCRIPTS.md`). Audit script-sync check unaffected (0 shared files).

### Changed (2026-06-21 — 2-Tier Matrix Restructure)

Refactored the **2-Tier Matrix Architecture** section in `README.md` and `README_ko.md` from a flat list (Functional Service rows + redundant Industry Coordinator rows) into a true **Tier 1 (rows) × Tier 2 (columns) matrix**. Industry domains (GxP, ehschem, gasterm, powergen, ehsconst, meddevice) are now column headers, eliminating duplicate coordinator rows and shortening the Pharma column label to `GxP`. The exact applicability data (`✓` cells: psm=ehschem/gasterm/powergen; msds/training/emergency=all 6) is preserved. Both READMEs use an identical 16-line symmetric structure.

### Added (2026-06-17 — GVP Domain v1) — Final GxP Domain

### Changed (2026-06-17 — Audit Script GMP Extension)
- `scripts/safety-audit.ts` v2.0.1 → v2.1.0:
  - Added GMP workflow validation: multi-source `legal_basis` (array, ≥2 entries) check for `workflows/gmp/**/schema.yaml`
  - Added GMP evidence model validation: required common fields (`e_signature`, `qrm_assessment`, `nomenclature`, `audit_trail`) and `legal_basis.minItems ≥ 2` for `evidence-models/gmp-*.json`
  - Added role separation check: verify `risk-assessment-agent.md` references `gmp-qrm` and `product quality`; verify `gmp-qrm/SKILL.md` references `risk-assessment-agent`
  - Report now shows GMP-specific counts: `(${gmpSchemaFiles.length} GMP)` and `(${gmpEvidenceFiles.length} GMP)`

### Fixed (2026-06-16 — MCP Server Connectivity)
- Corrected `bun` arg order in `.mcp.json` and `.gemini/settings.json` — `bun --env-file .env run` → `bun run --env-file .env` (this bun version requires subcommand before flags; all 3 servers were silently failing to start)

### Added (2026-06-16 — legalize_kr v1.1.0)
- `mcp/legalize-kr/tools/admrule.ts` — `search_admrule` tool: keyword search over `.cache/admrule-kr/` (고용노동부 고시·예규·훈령)
- `mcp/legalize-kr/tools/precedent.ts` — `search_precedent` tool: GitHub Search API over `legalize-kr/precedent-kr` (62K판례, GITHUB_TOKEN required)
- `mcp/legalize-kr/git-sync.ts` — `ensureAdmruleKRRepo()` for shallow-cloning `admrule-kr` into `.cache/admrule-kr/`
- `.cache/admrule-kr/` — shallow clone of `legalize-kr/admrule-kr` (21,675 files)

### Changed (2026-06-16 — Config & Cleanup)
- `.gemini/settings.json` mcpServers updated to local `bun run` servers (removed stale `korean-law`, `mcp-kr-legislation`, `k-skill` npx entries)
- `.claude/settings.json` stale `mcpServers` block removed (authoritative config is `.mcp.json`)
- `.claude/settings.local.json` pruned — removed stale `vendor/` permission entries and codegraph npx permission
- `mcp/LICENSE_REVIEW.md` — moved from `vendor/LICENSE_REVIEW.md` (missed in directory rename)
- `AGENTS.md` — added `## Regulatory Scope` section (Tier 1–4 law registry); removed `regulations/KR/` reference from Section A agent structure

### Removed (2026-06-16 — Codegraph & Regulations)
- Removed codegraph MCP servers (`codegraph_search`, `codegraph_mutate`) from `.mcp.json`
- Removed codegraph entries from `.claude/settings.json` and `.gemini/settings.json`
- Deleted `docs/blueprint/appendix/J-codegraph-integration.md`
- Deleted `regulations/` folder (28 YAML files) — tier classification consolidated into `AGENTS.md ## Regulatory Scope`

### Changed (2026-06-16 — MCP Directory Rename)
- Renamed `vendor/` to `mcp/` for semantic clarity — servers are first-party MCP implementations, not third-party dependencies
- Renamed `mcp/mcp-kr-legislation/` to `mcp/kr-legislation/` — removed redundant `mcp-` prefix
- Updated `.mcp.json` server paths to reflect new directory structure
- MCP server names (`k_skill`, `legalize_kr`, `mcp_kr_legislation`) remain unchanged

### Added (2026-06-16 — MCP Server Implementation)
- Implemented `vendor/k-skill/` MCP server v1.0.0 — OSHA/SAPA regulation search with 24h caching (`search_osha_regulations`, `get_sapa_requirements`, `list_industry_controls`, `check_compliance_gaps`, `invalidate_cache`)
- Implemented `vendor/legalize-kr/` MCP server v1.0.0 — Korean law structure parsing from git repo (`parse_law_structure`, `find_references`, `get_law_metadata`, `compare_versions`)
- Implemented `vendor/mcp-kr-legislation/` MCP server v1.0.0 — real-time legislation API via 국가법령정보센터 (`get_current_law`, `get_law_amendments`, `interpret_regulation`, `get_penalties`, `get_compliance_guide`)
- Added `vendor/shared/` infrastructure — `types.ts`, `logger.ts`, `errors.ts`, `retry.ts`, `rate-limiter.ts`
- Added `vendor/mcp-kr-legislation/xml-parser.ts` — XML parsing with Korean encoding fallback using `fast-xml-parser`
