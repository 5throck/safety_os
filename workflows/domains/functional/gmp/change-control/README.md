# 변경관리 (Change Control) Workflow

## 1. Objective
Ensure that all changes to facilities, equipment, processes, materials, documentation, or organization affecting GMP compliance are properly evaluated, approved, implemented, and documented before execution, per KP-GMP 의약품등기준규정 Article 18 and ICH Q10.

## 2. Applicability
This workflow applies to all GMP-regulated changes at pharmaceutical manufacturing sites under the `pharma-general` profile, except replacements-in-kind (RIK).

## 3. Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Change Request Initiation
- Initiator submits change request with description, rationale, technical basis, and scope.

### Step 2: Impact Assessment (Quality Risk Management)
- Apply ICH Q9 methodology via `skills/gmp-qrm/` (typically FMEA or cQRM-HAZOP).
- Document impact on: product quality, validated state, regulatory filings, stability, supplier qualification.

### Step 3: Multi-Disciplinary Review
- QA, Production, Engineering, Regulatory, and (if applicable) Medical review the proposed change.
- Verify compliance with applicable regulations (KP-GMP, PIC/S, ICH).

### Step 4: Approval
- Obtain required approvals (Section B of gmp-change-control-record.json).
- For major/critical changes: QA Manager and RP (Responsible Person) approval mandatory.

### Step 5: Implementation Planning
- Define implementation tasks, training requirements, and timeline.
- Identify dependent actions (re-validation, re-qualification, stability studies).

### Step 6: Pre-Implementation Verification
- Confirm all prerequisites met (training completed, materials available, documents updated).

### Step 7: Implementation & Effectiveness Check
- Execute the change.
- Define effectiveness check criteria and timeline (typically 30-90 days).

### Step 8: Closure
- Verify effectiveness check passed.
- Archive evidence record with multi-source legal_basis and e-signature.

## 4. Evidence Record
Generate `gmp-change-control-record.json` to `memory/` with required common fields (`e_signature`, `qrm_assessment`, `nomenclature`, `audit_trail`).

## 5. PSM Equivalent
This workflow reuses the pattern from `workflows/psm/moc-process.md` (90% reuse per architecture decision). Key difference: GMP change control includes quality impact assessment in addition to safety impact.

## 6. Legal Disclaimer
> Workflow automation assistance only. Final change approval and regulatory filing decisions require qualified QA and Regulatory Affairs professionals.
