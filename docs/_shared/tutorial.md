# Safety OS Getting Started Tutorial

> **Audience**: First-time users of Safety OS — EHS managers, safety and health officers, and compliance officers.
> **Time required**: Approximately 15 minutes (reading + hands-on practice).
> **Prerequisites**: None. Familiarity with Korean EHS/GxP work is sufficient.

## 1. What is Safety OS?

Safety OS is **an AI agent team for Korean EHS (Environment, Health, and Safety) and GxP regulatory compliance**. Instead of single-handedly tracking and documenting dozens of regulations — the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA-KR), the Serious Accidents Punishment Act (SAPA), the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act, the Chemical Substances Control Act, and more — Safety OS's AI agents analyze your situation, identify the applicable legal provisions, and execute the appropriate work procedure (workflow).

How Safety OS works is straightforward. You describe your current situation, and the PM agent (acting as CSO, Chief Safety Officer) classifies the request and dispatches the responsible specialist agent. The specialist agent executes the regulation-driven workflow and generates an **evidence record** in JSON format. This evidence record becomes the foundational document of your audit trail. You do not need to memorize regulations or fill out forms by hand.

---

## 2. The Agent Team You Need to Know Before You Start

Safety OS is an agent team organized in a hierarchy. You always send requests to the **PM agent (CSO)**. Calling specialist agents directly is not supported.

### Agent Role Summary

| Agent | Role | What it produces |
|-------|------|------------------|
| **PM (CSO)** | Coordinator. Single point of contact for all requests. Verifies legal basis, then dispatches specialist agents | Execution plan table, audit log |
| **psm-agent** | Process Safety Management (PSM) specialist. Executes PHA, MOC, PSSR, PSI, MI, SOP, LOTO | `psm-moc-record.json`, `psm-pssr-record.json`, `psm-loto-record.json` |
| **msds-agent** | Chemical substance data and GHS classification specialist | `msds-record.json`, `ghs-classification-record.json` |
| **training-agent** | Safety training management (OSHA-KR Article 29/31/32) | `training-record.json` |
| **ehschem-agent** | Chemical plant operations coordinator. Dispatches psm, msds, emergency | `ehschem-plant-safety-record.json` |
| **ehsconst-agent** | Construction site operations coordinator. Manages fall hazards, work permits, TBM | `ehsconst-inspection-record.json` |
| **gasterm-agent** | Gas terminal and filling station coordinator | `gasterm-operation-record.json` |
| **powergen-agent** | Power generation facility coordinator | `powergen-operation-record.json` |
| **gmp/gdp/glp/gcp/gvp-agent** | Pharmaceutical GxP stage-specific specialist agents | Stage-specific GxP records |
| **meddevice-agent** | Medical device coordinator (ISO 13485, ISO 14971) | `meddevice-record.json` |
| **emergency-agent** | Emergency response (dispatchable from all domains) | `emergency-response-record.json` |

### Core Principle

```
User → PM (CSO) → Industry-domain agent (coordinator)
                       └→ Functional-domain agent (service provider)
                       └→ emergency-agent (when an emergency occurs)
```

## 3. Your First Task: 5-Minute Quick Start

### Situation Setup

> "I am the EHS manager at a chemical plant. We are installing a new pump in a covered process area. I need to handle Management of Change (MOC) safely."

This situation requires a PSM Management of Change workflow under **OSHA-KR Article 44** (workplaces required to submit a Process Safety Report). Follow the steps below to converse with Safety OS.

---

### Step 1 — Describe the Situation to the PM Agent

**What you enter:**
```
I am going to install a new pump in a covered process area.
Please start the PSM MOC procedure. Target process: sulfuric acid transfer line (workplace subject to OSHA-KR Article 44).
```

**Example PM (CSO) response:**
```
[PM — CSO] Request received.

Legal basis verification:
- OSHA-KR Article 44 (obligation to submit a Process Safety Report)
- OSHA-KR Enforcement Rule Annex 13 (PSM elements: Management of Change)
- SAPA Article 4 (obligation to maintain a safety and health management system)

Classification: Tier 2 chemical plant (ehschem) + Tier 1 PSM service dispatch required

Execution plan:
1. ehschem-agent (coordinator) → set plant context
2. psm-agent (service) → execute MOC workflow
3. evidence record generation → psm-moc-record.json

Dispatching ehschem-agent...
```

---

### Step 2 — The Industry Coordinator Sets the Context

**Example ehschem-agent response:**
```
[ehschem-agent] Chemical plant context confirmed.

Plant type: Fine chemicals / includes covered process
PSM obligation: Yes (psm_applicable: true)
Target process: Sulfuric acid transfer line
Change type: New equipment installation (pump)

Dispatching the MOC workflow to psm-agent.
```

---

### Step 3 — The PSM Agent Executes MOC

**Example psm-agent response:**
```
[psm-agent] Starting the MOC workflow.

Collecting change information:
  Change number: MOC-2026-047
  Change type: Equipment replacement / new installation
  Affected process: Sulfuric acid transfer line (per P&ID Rev. 12)
  Expected hazards: Sulfuric acid leak, electrical arc, confined-space proximity

Hazard assessment:
  PHA method: HAZOP (with What-If in parallel)
  Identified hazards:
    - Pump seal failure → sulfuric acid leak (severity: HIGH, frequency: LOW)
    - Poor piping connection → pressure anomaly (severity: MEDIUM, frequency: LOW)

Safety measures:
  - Dual-seal pump specification required
  - Update PSI (Process Safety Information) before installation
  - Conduct PSSR (Pre-Startup Safety Review) before startup approval
  - Revise relevant SOPs and train workers

Generating evidence record...
```

---

### Step 4 — Review the Generated Evidence Record

**What you enter:**
```
Show me the evidence record.
```

**Example psm-moc-record.json generated by psm-agent** (matches `evidence-models/domains/functional/psm/psm-moc-record.json` v1.0.0):
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "record_id": "PSM-MOC-2026-0047",
  "change_id": "MOC-2026-047",
  "title": "Sulfuric acid transfer line — new pump installation",
  "description": "Replace the existing single-seal pump with a dual-seal pump on the sulfuric acid transfer line per P&ID Rev. 12, to address the seal-failure leak risk identified during HAZOP.",
  "change_type": "permanent",
  "classification": "major",
  "status": "under_review",
  "legal_basis": [
    "산업안전보건법 Article 44 (공정안전관리 — 변경관리)",
    "산업안전보건법 Article 38 (작업 전 안전조치)",
    "안전보건기준에관한규칙 Article 92 (정비 등 작업 시 운전정지 등)"
  ],
  "timestamp": "2026-06-20T09:32:15+09:00",
  "agent_id": "psm-agent",
  "workflow_id": "psm/moc-process",
  "hazard_review": {
    "assessment_type": "HAZOP",
    "findings": [
      "Pump seal failure -> sulfuric acid leak (severity: HIGH, frequency: LOW); mitigated by dual-seal pump spec + leak detector",
      "Poor piping connection -> pressure anomaly (severity: MEDIUM, frequency: LOW)"
    ],
    "completed_by": "PSM Team Lead",
    "completion_date": "2026-06-25T00:00:00+09:00"
  },
  "approval_chain": [
    { "role": "Process Engineer", "approver_id": "eng-042", "approval_date": "2026-06-26T00:00:00+09:00", "decision": "approved", "comments": "PSI updated; proceed to PSSR." },
    { "role": "Safety Manager", "approver_id": "safety-mgr-01", "approval_date": "2026-06-27T00:00:00+09:00", "decision": "pending", "comments": "Awaiting PSSR completion before sign-off." }
  ]
}
```

This single JSON file is the audit evidence record that tracks the entire MOC process. Note that `psm-moc-record.json` does not use the common `e_signature`/`nomenclature`/`audit_trail` `$ref` block that most other evidence models share — provenance here is tracked via `timestamp`/`agent_id`/`workflow_id` instead, and the approval trail lives in `approval_chain`.

## 5. How to Read an Evidence Record

Using the `psm-moc-record.json` generated above, this section explains the role of each part during an audit.

### Key Field Guide

| Field | Role | What to check during an audit |
|-------|------|-------------------------------|
| `record_id` | Unique identifier (`PSM-MOC-YYYY-NNNN`). Used for cross-referencing with other records | Whether numbers are managed sequentially |
| `version` | Evidence model schema version | Whether the version matches the currently active `psm-moc-record.json` schema |
| `legal_basis` | Applicable legal provisions. **A minimum of 3 is mandatory** | The first item an auditor checks |
| `title` / `description` / `change_type` / `classification` | What the change is, its duration category, and risk classification | ALCOA+ Attributable / Contemporaneous evidence |
| `hazard_review` | HAZOP/PHA results: `assessment_type`, `findings[]`, `completed_by`, `completion_date` | Whether risk assessment was substantively performed |
| `approval_chain` | Sequential approvals: `role`, `approver_id`, `approval_date`, `decision`, `comments` | Whether all required approvers signed off before implementation |
| `timestamp` / `agent_id` / `workflow_id` | Record provenance — when the record was created, by which agent, under which workflow execution | Whether the record can be traced back to its originating workflow run |

### What are the ALCOA+ principles?

All evidence records in Safety OS follow the **ALCOA+** data integrity principles.

| Principle | English | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **A** | Attributable | Identifiable as to who performed the action |
| **L** | Legible | Readable and permanently preservable |
| **C** | Contemporaneous | Recorded at the time of the action |
| **O** | Original | The first record (not a copy) |
| **A** | Accurate | Free of errors |
| **+C** | Complete | A complete record |
| **+C** | Consistent | Consistent with other records |
| **+E** | Enduring | Complies with the regulatory retention period |
| **+A** | Available | Immediately accessible when needed |

## 6. Five Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1 — Trying to call a specialist agent directly, skipping the PM

All requests in Safety OS **must go through the PM (CSO)**. Calling psm-agent, msds-agent, and others directly is not supported. The reason is simple — the correct agent is dispatched only after the PM verifies the legal basis (`legal_basis`) and determines whether multi-domain coordination is needed. Skipping the PM may produce evidence records without legal basis.

**Correct approach:**
```
✗ "psm-agent, start MOC"
✓ "I am installing a new pump in a covered process. Please start the PSM MOC procedure."
```

### Mistake 2 — Confusing PSM training with general safety training

PSM has **12 elements**, of which **Element 4 is Training**. This is a training record within the PSM workflow and is distinct from the `training` domain.

| Category | Where it is handled | Legal basis |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| PSM Training (Element 4) | Inside psm-agent | OSHA-KR Enforcement Rule Annex 13 |
| General safety and health training | training-agent | OSHA-KR Article 29/31/32 |
| New chemical substance training notification | msds-agent → occupational-health | OSHA-KR Article 114 |

### Mistake 3 — Mistaking an evidence record for an official report

The JSON evidence record generated by Safety OS is a **workflow execution record**. It does **not replace official administrative documents** such as the Process Safety Report (PSR), Chemical Impact Assessment, or MFDS reports.

Uses of the evidence record:
- Internal audit trail
- Compliance documentation supporting material
- Proof of work-procedure implementation

Official document submission must be done separately by the responsible person. Safety OS is a tool that helps you prepare for it.

### Mistake 4 — Handling a PSM-covered facility as a general safety inspection without knowing it is subject to PSM

Workplaces with a covered process are subject to PSM under OSHA-KR Article 44. This applies not only to chemical plants but also potentially to **large-scale LNG terminals, LPG bases, and large-scale LNG thermal power plants**. Regardless of which industry domain your facility falls under, confirm with the PM whether you are subject to PSM first.

```
To PM: "Please confirm whether our facility is subject to PSM.
        We operate an LNG terminal with a storage capacity of __ tons."
```

### Mistake 5 — Attempting a normal workflow during an emergency

In the event of fire, chemical leak, explosion, or serious accident, **do not start a regular workflow.** Immediately notify the PM that it is an emergency, and the `emergency-agent` will be dispatched right away.

```
✗ "Please check the MSDS for a chemical leak" (regular workflow)
✓ "Emergency: sulfuric acid leak occurred. Immediate response required." → emergency-agent immediate dispatch
```
