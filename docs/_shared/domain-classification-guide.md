# Domain Classification Guide

> **Purpose**: Clarify the functional/industrial domain mix in Safety OS, and guide users in selecting the appropriate domain (or multi-domain dispatch) at request time.

## 1. Why This Guide Exists

Safety OS has 10+ active domains. Historically, two natures have been mixed together:

- **Functional domains**: Industry-agnostic; methodology- or data-driven (PSM, MSDS, Training)
- **Industry domains**: Centered on a specific industry's operations (ehsconst, gasterm, powergen, ehschem, meddevice, GxP family — gmp/gdp/glp/gcp/gvp)

Consequences of the mixed layout:
- Chemical-plant users were unsure whether to invoke `psm`, `msds`, `ehschem`, or `emergency`.
- Within the same industry, multiple agencies' regulations apply simultaneously, yet it was unclear which domain acts as the integrating coordinator.
- For large facilities such as LNG terminals and power plants, PSM also applies, but where it is handled was ambiguous.

This guide organizes the domains into a **3-tier classification system**.

## 2. 3-Tier Domain Classification

### Tier 1: Functional Domains
**Characteristic**: Industry-agnostic. Centered on methodology, data, and system management. Referenced by multiple industry domains.

| Domain | Function | Example applicable industries |
|--------|----------|-------------------------------|
| `psm` | Process safety management methodology (PHA, MOC, PSSR, MI, PSI, SOP) | Chemicals, refining, **LNG/LPG bases**, large-scale power generation, semiconductors (specialty gases) |
| `msds` | Chemical substance data management (16 sections) | All industries (whenever chemicals are handled) |
| `training` | Safety training management (OSHA-KR Art 13/29/31/32/114) | All industries |

### Tier 2: Industry Domains
**Characteristic**: Centered on a specific industry's operations. Integrates the multi-agency regulations for that industry.

| Domain | Industry | Integrated regulations |
|--------|----------|------------------------|
| `gmp` | Pharmaceutical manufacturing quality | 약사법 (Pharmaceutical Affairs Act) Art 34, PIC/S, ICH Q7/Q9/Q10 |
| `gdp` | Pharmaceutical distribution quality | 약사법 Art 47, EU GDP Guidelines |
| `glp` | Non-clinical study management | 비임상시험관리기준 (Non-clinical Study Management Standards), OECD GLP |
| `gcp` | Clinical trial management | 약사법 Art 34의2, ICH E6(R3) |
| `gvp` | Post-market pharmacovigilance | 약사법 Art 73의2/73의3, KGVP, ICH E2 |
| `ehsconst` | Construction | 산안법 (OSHA-KR), 중대재해처벌법 (SAPA, construction-industry special provisions), 건설기술진흥법 (Construction Technology Promotion Act) |
| `gasterm` | Gas terminals / filling stations | 고압가스법 (High-Pressure Gas Safety Act), LPG법 (LPG Act), 수소법 (Hydrogen Act) |
| `powergen` | Power generation facilities (excluding nuclear) | 전기사업법 (Electricity Business Act), 전기안전관리법 (Electrical Safety Management Act), 신재생에너지법 (New and Renewable Energy Act) |
| `ehschem` | Chemical plants (refining / petrochemical / fine chemicals) | 산안법 (OSHA-KR), 화학물질관리법 (Chemical Substances Control Act), K-REACH, 위험물안전관리법 (Hazardous Materials Safety Control Act) |
| `meddevice` | Medical devices | KGMP-MD, ISO 13485, ISO 14971 |

### Tier 3: Cross-Cutting Services
**Characteristic**: Referenced by all domains. Emergency response, routine inspections, and the like.

| Service | Role |
|---------|------|
| `emergency/` (9 workflows) | Fire, natural disasters, medical, chemical release, explosion, confined-space / high-angle rescue, electrocution, mechanical accidents |
| `daily/` workflows | Routine EHS such as risk assessment, permit-to-work, and safety inspections |

## 3. Multi-Domain Dispatch Guide

### Principle: Industry domains are the integrating coordinator (Tier 2-led)

```
User (worker in a specific industry)
  ↓
Tier 2 industry domain (integrating coordinator)
  ├── Dispatches to Tier 1 functional domains as needed
  └── Dispatches to Tier 3 emergency on incident
```

### Example: LNG terminal operator

```
[Routine operations]
→ gasterm-agent (Tier 2, integrating coordinator)
  ├── Gas storage tank inspection (gasterm itself)
  ├── Chemical handling (MEA/MDEA) data needed → msds-agent (Tier 1)
  └── Large-scale facility risk assessment → psm-agent (Tier 1)

[Emergency]
→ emergency-agent (Tier 3)
  ├── Runs explosion-gas-response directly
  ├── msds Section 6 data needed → provided by gasterm or msds-agent
  └── Evacuation / access control / notification
```

### Example: Chemical plant operator

```
[Routine operations]
→ ehschem-agent (Tier 2, integrating coordinator, planned)
  ├── Chemical plant routine operations (ehschem itself)
  ├── Chemical substance handling → msds-agent (Tier 1)
  ├── Large-scale hazardous processes → psm-agent (Tier 1)
  └── Hazardous materials storage → msds + ehschem collaboration

[Emergency]
→ emergency-agent (Tier 3)
  ├── Runs chemical-release directly
  ├── msds Section 6 data → msds-agent
  └── psm-psi (process safety information) → psm-agent
```

### Example: Power plant (LNG thermal) operator

```
[Routine operations]
→ powergen-agent (Tier 2, integrating coordinator)
  ├── Power generation facility operations (powergen itself)
  ├── LNG gas supply → gasterm-agent (Tier 2, industry collaboration)
  ├── Large-scale gas process (PSM mandatory) → psm-agent (Tier 1)
  └── Chemical treatment (e.g., ammonia for NOx removal) → msds-agent (Tier 1)
```

## 4. PSM Applicability Scenarios (reflecting the LNG terminal question)

PSM (산업안전보건법 제44조) applies to facilities with a "covered process." It is not limited to chemical plants; the following facilities are also mandatorily subject to PSM:

| Facility type | PSM mandatory | Owning industry domain | Interface |
|---------------|---------------|------------------------|-----------|
| Refinery | ✓ | `ehschem` | `psm_record_ref` bidirectional |
| Petrochemical plant | ✓ | `ehschem` | `psm_record_ref` bidirectional |
| **LNG terminal (large-scale)** | ✓ | `gasterm` | `psm_applicable: true` field |
| **LPG base (large-scale)** | ✓ | `gasterm` | `psm_applicable: true` field |
| LNG thermal power plant (large-scale gas) | ✓ | `powergen` | `psm_applicable` field (to be added) |
| Hydrogen filling station (large-scale) | Partial | `gasterm` | `psm_applicable` conditional |
| Semiconductor (specialty gases) | Partial | (ehssemi, planned) | - |
| Pharmaceutical (large-scale chemical) | Partial | `gmp` | gmp and psm collaboration |

**Implementation principles**:
- `psm-agent` is the functional coordinator (provides PSM methodology).
- An industry domain's evidence model flags applicability via a `psm_applicable: boolean` field.
- When `psm_applicable: true`, the facility collaborates in parallel with psm-agent.

### PSM interface in `gasterm` (already implemented)

```yaml
# gasterm evidence model
psm_applicable: true  # for large-scale LNG/LPG facilities
psm_record_ref: "PSM-..."  # psm-record ID
```

### `powergen` PSM interface (already implemented)

The `psm_applicable` field has been added to the powergen evidence model (reflected across 7 records):
- LNG thermal power plant (large-scale gas handling) — PSM mandatory
- Thermal power boiler (large-scale, high-pressure) — PSM mandatory

This guide is a dispatch aid for users. Final domain selection is at the discretion of the PM (CSO). When multi-domain collaboration is required, the PM coordinates it.
