# Part XII — Implementation Strategy

> **⚠️ Historical v4.0 design note (updated 2026-06):** The **CodeGraph** MCP and **Neo4j Knowledge Graph** described here were **NOT IMPLEMENTED** and have been archived (see [`_meta/archive/code-graph/README.md`](../archive/code-graph/README.md)). Live regulatory traceability uses `evidence-models/*.json` + workflow `legal_basis` fields + `regulations/KR/legal-glossary.yaml` SSOT. Graph references below are design history only.

## Phase 0: Foundation and Scaffolding

*   **Objective**: Establish the core architecture, repository structure, and initial agent definitions.
*   **Key Deliverables**:
    *   Project scaffolding and directory structure.
    *   Base platform configuration (`CONSTITUTION.md`, `AGENTS.md`).
    *   Initial PM (CSO) agent deployment and gateway enforcement testing.
*   **Scope**: Internal engineering team focus.

## Phase A: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope

*   **Objective**: Deploy the Priority 1 agents to handle basic compliance and critical workflows.
*   **Key Deliverables**:
    *   Deployment of SGM, SWM, Compliance, Risk, Emergency, and Audit agents.
    *   Implementation of the foundational Permit-to-Work (PTW) workflow.
    *   Basic risk assessment and hazard reporting pipelines.
    *   Establishment of the immutable evidence trail system.
*   **Scope**: Core manufacturing operations and baseline OSHA-KR/SAPA compliance.

## Phase 1: Operational Deepening

*   **Objective**: Introduce Priority 2 agents to cover complex operational scenarios.
*   **Key Deliverables**:
    *   Integration of PSM, Incident Investigation, Contractor, and Asset agents.
    *   Automated Root Cause Analysis (RCA) reporting.
    *   Contractor compliance tracking and gate access control integration.
    *   Management of Change (MOC) workflows.

## Phase 2 Extensions: Advanced Capabilities

Phase 2 focuses on scaling the system from a reactive compliance tool to a proactive, intelligent ecosystem.

*   **Knowledge Engineering**: Deployment of the Knowledge Graph Agent to map complex relationships between incidents, near-misses, machine telemetry, and regulatory clauses.
*   **Industry Expansion**: Adapting the core models to support specific industry verticals beyond general manufacturing (e.g., chemical processing, construction).
*   **Agent/Skill Expansion**: Introduction of the Legal Intelligence Agent and Training Agent, along with the development of custom skills for integrating with third-party ERP and HR systems.

## Phase 3-8: Continuous Iteration and Integration

*   **Objective**: Iterative enhancement based on user feedback and changing regulations.
*   **Key Deliverables**:
    *   Advanced predictive analytics dashboards.
    *   Integration with IoT sensors for real-time hazard detection.
    *   Cross-facility benchmarking and standardization.

## Phase 9: Full Autonomous Governance

*   **Objective**: Achieve mature, highly automated EHS governance requiring minimal human intervention for routine compliance.
*   **Key Deliverables**:
    *   Self-auditing systems.
    *   Automated regulatory filing and reporting.
    *   AI-driven continuous improvement of safety protocols.
